  "intro": "Im many survey a lot of detailled questions are being asked, in order to classify the pariticpants afterwards. Or adress data is being collected in order to deduce things, like for example, if one lives in an urban or rural area. The original data is often not required any more, from this point on. In contrast to broader derived classes, the original detailed personal information, can expose indidivuals to privacy risk and being identified in the data (see also privacy sampling LINK). The method presented on this site, peforms the classification directly in the Browser and only submits the class-data and, thereby, protects the individual's privacy.",

  "ch2_intro": "In the context of privacy, personal high resolution spatial data is extremely sensitive, as it can easily lead to the identification of individuals in the data. Further more it is the most challenging aspect of client-side classification, as it can require the lookup of spatial classes in large data sets, which require progressive loading approaches in order to keep the amount of data transfered to the client as small as possible.",
  "ch2_h4_1": "Spatial units",
  "ch2_p1": "Interactions and, therefore, interfaces in surveys should be accessible, easy and quick to use. If it is possible to produce a classification through a well know spatial classification, like e.g. postcodes or names of spatial units like cities or states, one should use those, instead of the interactions below.",

  "ch2_t1": "If you only have a few attributes you want to derive from the spatial unit or a small number of spatial units overall, you can simply load the whole dataset into the browser. For other cases you might want to use a progressive approach and only load data that is required. Loading data based on user-input holds one possible privacy risk. Let's assume we use postcode for classification, the user inputs the postcode and the classification data is loaded from the server. Depending on the server's setup, this could lead to a logging of the postcode and, therefore, a connection between postcode and user. In the implementation used in this prototype, we overcome this by not only loading the postcode requested by the user, but also a random set of other postcodes, thereby creating noise and hiding the actual request from the individual user.",
  "ch2_h4_2": "Modes of localization",
  "ch2_p2": "In some cases spatial units might be to general and a more exact location is required. For those cases there are basically two options: manually pin-point the location using a so called slippy-map or using the location features (e.g. GPS) of the user's device.",
  "ch2_demo_title_1":"Identify the climate zone someone lives in:",
  "ch2_p2_1": "The geolocation feature could also easily be used without a map, but be aware that not all devices support geolocation. Furthermore, this feature only provides the <strong>current</strong> position of the user, which might not be helpful if you are trying to find out e.g. where people live or work.",
  "ch2_t2": "Similar to the spatial units, when the participant uses the map to identify her location, data is being loaded from the server. This could, again, be used to log the actual location input of the user. To overcome this, we have also implemented randomized shadow map interactions, that create noise to cover the user's actual interactions.",

  "ch2_p7": "Many websites offer adress search for locating a position on a map. All those websites use so called geocoding-services. The user sends a text to such a service and the service tries to find the closest match in a database of locations. When we try to develop a privacy-first approach, sending your personal adress to a remote server, maybe even a third-party service like Google, is a violation of this paradigm. The adress-information can be logged and cross-referenced with additional information collected about the user. For this reason the above examples have proposed other techniques of identifying a location.",
